WooCommerce has a built-in notices feature that appears on your store in difference cases, they used to show important messages for customers, like:

* Product X has been added to your cart (Product notice)
* Product X removed. Undo? (Cart notice)
* Have a coupon? Click here to enter your code (Checkout notice)
* X is a required field (checkout)

And so on...

And sometimes, depending on the theme, they get so discreet customers don't see it or there are cases where they are just too ugly.

Our plugin **Popup Notices for WooCommercee** turns these WooCommerce Notices into beautiful Popups that will be noticed by your customers.
