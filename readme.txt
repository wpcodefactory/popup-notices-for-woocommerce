Turn your WooCommerce Notices into Popups

== Description ==

Notices are important messages WooCommerce displays on your store for customers, like:

* Product has been added to cart
* Field Name is a required field
* Have a coupon?
* And so on...

And sometimes, depending on the theme, they get so discreet customers don't see it or there are cases where they are just too ugly.

**Popup Notices for WooCommercee** adds WooCommerce Notices into beautiful Popups that will be noticed and appreciated.
